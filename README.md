## üìù Project Steps

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection  

The **[Football-Data.org](https://www.football-data.org/)** API was used to collect data on matches, teams, squads, and statistics from the **Premier League**. To extract this information, specific functions were developed in **AWS Lambda**, located in the `/lambda_function` directory.

The main files involved are:
- **matches**: Data about played matches.
- **scorers**: Information about the league's top scorers.
- **teams**: Data on teams, players, and coaches.

These data cover the **2022/2023**, **2023/2024**, and **2024/2025** seasons.

To trigger these Lambda functions, an API was created in **AWS API Gateway** (configuration in `swagger.json` file, located in `/api_gateway`)

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Storing Raw Data in S3  

Raw data is stored in the **`futeboltotal220`** bucket in **AWS S3**, ensuring scalability and security. To maintain organization, a **`raw`** folder was created, containing subfolders: `matches`, `persons`, `scorers`, and `teams`. These folders help categorize extracted data.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Processing in Databricks  

The data is processed in an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline within **Databricks**, where it is cleaned, transformed, and organized.

There are **11 notebooks**, located in `/databricks`, responsible for extracting and processing data before sending it to **Power BI**:

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Storing Processed Data in S3  

Processed data is stored in the **`futeboltotal220`** bucket in **AWS S3**, ensuring scalability and security. To maintain organization, a **`processed`** folder was created, containing subfolders: `matches`, `persons`, `scorers`, `season_team_player`, `season`, and `teams`.

CSV files for loading into Power BI are in the `pbi` folder.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Dashboard  

**Access the Dashboard**: [Dashboard Link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTQwZTY4YjItNmM4YS00ZTg2LWI1ZTQtYjYxMzEzNjI1MjZjIiwidCI6ImZiYmE0ZjhmLWYzNmUtNDUzNC04ZWZiLThhOWU1ODU4YTk4ZSJ9)  

After processing, the data is loaded into **Power BI**, using a **Snowflake model**. This model was necessary because a team has multiple players, and squads change each season.

Additionally, three extra dimensions were created:

- **d_season_team**: Contains only one column (`season_team_id`) and acts as a **bridge table** to avoid many-to-many relationships.
- **d_coaches**: Created from the `tb_persons.csv` file, storing coaches.
- **d_players**: Also created from the `tb_persons.csv` file, storing players.

![Dashboard Model](images/dashboard_modelo.png)  

The dashboard was developed with **Premier League** data and is divided into **3 main tabs**:

#### üìä *League Table*  
Displays the Premier League standings, showing each club's position, points, and other detailed statistics.

Also highlights:
- **Champion coach** of the season.
- **League top scorer**.
- **Player with the most assists**.

Users can apply **filters** to view data from the last **3 seasons**.

#### ‚öΩ *Matches*  
Shows all Premier League matches with respective results.

#### üìà *Statistics*  
Displays detailed statistics for each season, including:
- **Average goals per match**.
- **Percentage of home and away wins**.
- **Games with 3 or more goals**.
- **Match with the most goals in the season**.
- **List of top scorers and players with most goal contributions**.
